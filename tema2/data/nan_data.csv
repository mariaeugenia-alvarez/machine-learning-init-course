They came from buying a computer and paying for additional graduate school expenses.  I'd rather pay you 10%! I also need to buy a car for my new job. I estimate 4K to get something used but reliable with decent gas mileage. I have a BA already and MBA in progress.  I understand the fundamentals of finance and am looking forward to building a good credit history in taking and paying off this loan. It will be my first personal loan.  My new job is in business development with a start up company growing quickly.  My compensation agreement provides a reliable, moderate income base salary with a strong performance incentive structure. This personal loan would help me get more rapidly into a sound financial position and make me much more content about who I am paying interest to! I look forward to doing business with you. Thank you very much.<br/> look forward to doing business with you and paying interest to my peers rather than multinational institutions.<br/>",,,64.0,984555

Micros Systems Inc.,10+ years,"  Borrower added on 07/06/10 > test<br/> Borrower added on 07/06/10 > Hello, and thanks for reviewing my loan request.<br/>I am seeking a loan for $4000 to purchase a used car from a private seller.  I have been a Lending Club member for the last year or so, but until now only as a lender.  I have funded about 8 loans as a lender and I believe strongly in this lending model.  I'd much rather pay interest to a bunch of individual lenders than hand it off to a bank.<br/>Personal Information:<br/>- Married (2 years) with no kids<br/>- Wife works full time, our combined income around $100,000/year<br/>- Owned our house for almost 5 years.  We have a 30 year mortgage at 6% with a  balance of $127,000.  We also have a second mortgage with a balance of $12,000 at around 4%<br/>- No car payment at this time<br/>Work:<br/>- I have worked at the same company for almost 11 years. <br/>- I am a project manager for a software company.  We install computer systems in hotels and restaurants.  I work from home 5 days a week and travel occaisionally.  Not having a commute keeps my expenses low.  <br/>Financial:<br/>- We have been working the last couple years towards eliminating any consumer debt.  We focused on my wife's debt first and we're excited to say she is sending in the last check to her last credit card next week.<br/>- We have also been working on our savings and currently have around $6500 in an emergency fund.  I also keep $2000 &quot;padding&quot; in my checking account. I also have about $2000 in a brokerage account and 1000 stock options available to me from my company.  Total liquid savings are around $8500.<br/>- My credit score has been increasing as I pay down and use less and less of my available credit.  We've been doing the &quot;avalanche&quot; method of paying minimum payments to all my cards except the highest interest accounts and it's worked really well.  I've paid off 3 cards completely and am close to #4 next month.  With my current avalanche/snowball plan I will have all of them paid off in December of 2011, which feels great.<br/>- The total balance listed includes the $12,000 second mortgage, which is a HELOC.<br/>Plan for the loan:<br/>- I plan on purchasing a mid-90's Chevrolet Suburban.  There are some great deals on them now with gas prices rising again.  Thanks to my zero-mile commute, gas prices don't affect me too much.  I drive less than 10,000 miles a year.  I like the Suburbans because they are comfortable and have a lot of utility for either carrying lots of people or lots of stuff.<br/>- I am looking at trucks selling for anywhere between $3000 and $4000<br/>",,,,699868

Sun State Builders,4 years,"I am requesting a personal loan in the amount of $25,000. I have credit card debt that I would like to eliminate, especially since the two that carry high balances just notified me that they will be raising the interest rate in July. I have never been even one day late on these two cards. Currently I pay about $600 a month on various credit accounts and I determined that through a debt consolidation loan at around 11% interest for 5 years, I could pay off this debt and still be able to save half of what I am paying monthly to credit cards.   I am a single woman with a good job and own a home in Arizona. The condition of the housing market in AZ is dismal and hence I cannot obtain a home equity loan to pay this debt off. I have been working for my current employer for 4 years and feel confident that my job is secure. 8 years ago I had to declare bankruptcy due to my husband's suicide. He left me with an enormous amount of debt. However, since his passing in 1999, I have purchased 2 homes.   I am hoping that you will grant me this personal loan. None of my credit accounts (including my home) have been paid late. I have just let this debt get out of control and need to eliminate it all together. Thank you.",,,67.0,465029

Walker & Moody Architects,5 years,"  Borrower added on 10/26/10 > This is a small loan to pay off my variable rate Wells Fargo CC (linked to my checking) which is a headache. At the end of the day, the interest rate and payment works out about the same, but being free from the variable rate on the linked account will offer great peace of mind. I have plenty of room in my monthly budget, especially given that the amount of the Lending Club loan payment is roughly equivalent to my current automatic payment. <br/><br/>I found I was very satisfied with the fixed rate structure of my auto loan and have been looking for a similar solution to this one pesky credit card.<br/><br/> I have worked with the same architectural firm for over 5 years (part time at first, then full time for about 4 years now), and my employment is both stable and comfortable. I look forward to your support in my process of eradicating debt and welcome any questions you may have about myself.

Medin Corp,3 years," I am buying an engagement ring for my girlfriend.  I have several bank accounts with Valley National Bank in Wayne NJ some of which I have had over 15 years.  In that time I have had 3 personal loans and 1 auto loan.  All 4 loans were paid off early.  I bought a house in Midland Park with my brother in May of 2007.  The mortgage is $2900 a month.  I pay 50% and my brother pays 50%.  I contacted Valley about a personal loan for the engagement ring and they say that my 88,000.00 annual gross income doesn't cover my $2900 a month mortgage.  I explained to them that I only pay $1400 a month because I split the payment with my brother.  My brother and I both have Valley National Bank.  Valley can see we have a joint account for the last 2 -1/2 years that we both contribute equally and house expenses get deducted from this account.  Valley says that they need a cosigner on the loan because they can not assume that I split the mortgage even though they can plainly see we do split.  I would consider asking my brother or another family member to cosign on a Valley loan but I do not want anyone knowing my intentions to propose.  I am in a bit of a bind.  I need a personal loan for $6000.00 without any penalties for paying off early.  I also want it directly deducted from my checking account monthly.   ",,,63.0,521942

I am not a homeowner so a HELOC with a low rate is not available to me.  A personal loan is not feasible because of the  high interest rate even though my credit rating is in the mid 700's. I cannot borrow against my IRA (I looked to see if that was an option, either borrowing against it or using it as collateral and found out that neither was possible). I am gainfully employed, my union (Teamsters Local 25 Boston) having just negotiated a new 5 year contract so the possibility of my being unemployed at any time during the course of this loan would be nil.

Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Assocation,< 1 year,"Hello, all. The purpose of this loan is to provide the final tranche of funding for a long-planned, extensive interior renovation of my home. I purchased the home in October 2009, and got a great price because of the remodeling that was needed.   The person I bought the house with took off four months after we moved in, leaving me with the mortgage (I hold full title to the house), and in the financial scramble that followed, my credit rating took a hit, as I took out a bunch of credit cards and had to carry balances.  Since then, I have landed a job that pays more than both of our combined salaries when we bought the place. I am an in-house lobbyist for a clean energy company, in a senior position with a stable, annual salary.   I have a monthly disposable income of $4700--after mortgage payments. I have a tenant to help defray the mortgage, and this renovation will help make the house more comfortable for two people who do not share a bedroom. Right now the layout for the kitchen and common areas are cramped and poorly thought out--the house was originally flipped.  I've done as much work on the house as I can with my own hands--extensive landscaping and a new patio. Now it is time to work on the inside, and I am no plumber or carpenter or electrician. Because I haven't been in the house long, I'm not eligible for a home equity line of credit, but I do have a homeowner's loan and a personal loan from a credit union--however, banks are conservative these days and my credit score is still recovering from last year, so it is not quite enough.  I am turning to LendingClub to put me over the top for the renovation which this house needs, so it can be the place I envisioned when I bought it nearly two years ago. Home values are going up in my neighborhood, but I need this work to allow my home to express its true worth, and to be more livable for me and a tenant, as well to be more attractive any renters or sellers in the future should I ever move.   But I'm not planning to move for a while. I love my house. But the tiny kitchen and bathroom are starting to drive me bonkers. Thanks to all potential investors for helping me realize the wonderful home I have been waiting for.   I am happy to answer any questions, and thank you.  Update:   Thanks to everyone who has invested so far--this is an exciting process, and I hope we can get all the way to the goal in these last few days.   ",,,15.0,1041684

US Government,4 years,"  Borrower added on 04/13/10 > Purpose of Loan: To pay for part of a home improvement project on my parent's home.<br/><br/>Background: My parent's underestimated the amount of money required for their home improvement project. They are short $10k and need my help. If they do not get my help, work on the project will cease indefinitely. <br/><br/>Personal Background: I am single with no children. I have no other loans. I am an officer in the United States Marine Corps. My job is stable. <br/><br/>Financial Background: My net worth is over $50k. I save over half my net income. I have paid off $40,000 in student loans four years ahead of schedule. I pay my credit card in full every month and use it only for big ticket item purchases. For other daily expenses, I always pay cash. I drive a used car that is paid in full.<br/><br/>My monthly budget is as follow:<br/><br/>$1500: Expenses (rent, food, haircuts, gas, uniforms)<br/>$3300: Savings and Investment accounts<br/><br/>Why am I borrowing instead of using my own money?<br/><br/>Because most of my savings are tied up in CD's, index funds, and other less liquid accounts. Also, I cannot afford to use $10k of my own money because it will seriously deplete my rainy day fund. And I don't like using it for home improvement projects because it doesn't qualify as a rainy day eligible. <br/><br/>Last word: My record speaks strongly of me as a reliable borrower. I have a 780+ credit score, proven borrower track record, low debt to income ratio, a stable job with the US government, and plenty of leverage to cover this loan in a worst case scenario.<br/>",,,,620593

U.S. Department of Homeland Security,2 years,"  Borrower added on 07/26/10 > I am seeking this debt consolidation loan in order to expedite my return to a debt-free status by converting my high-interest credit card debt into a lower-interest personal loan.  Despite my credit score, which has prevented me from receiving a personal loan from a bank due to the current financial climate, I believe my credit report shows me to be a responsible user of credit with a 12-year record of timely payments.  I have always honored my debts by paying them on time, and I have never borrowed more than I could afford.  I currently pay $536 a month for all of my revolving credit accounts, and I could easily afford $700 a month for a personal loan, which is in line with this loan application.  I am a federal employee with 2-years of service, which means that I have completed my probationary period and have achieved permanent status.  I was promoted after 16-months of service, and I look forward to a long federal career.<br/>",,,,712900

I currently pay more than min. required (average $1,200 pmt on CC payments when my total required is approx. $300) on my bills but it's hard when they are scattered throughout the months. <br/><br/>I also have some medical bills for my 19mo old when she was a few months old that I can use this money to pay off ($800).<br/><br/>In addition, I am going to use some of this money to take a dream vacation that is long overdue (5 years since I taken a real vacation). And I want to save the rest for some for emergencies. <br/><br/>I have not been in my current job that long because it was an opportunity to move to a higher position in the field of childcare. My previous job as an Assistant Director, I have attained that for almost 5 years.<br/><br/>Thank you in advance for all who have helped in funding my loan. I greatly appreciate it.<br/> Borrower added on 02/24/10 > I want to add that my CC amount is not because of random spending. Majority (75%+) of the balance is from my husbands IRS taxes. Before I met him, his tax person was supposed to get an extension on taxes he owed for his business. Two years into our marriage we find out that he never got the extension and we owed almost doubled in back taxes. We have managed to pay over $12k in the last 3 years and decided to put the rest on my cards because they kept on assessing fees every month even when we worked out monthly payments with them. I just want to finish paying the taxes and move on. This is why we weren't able to take a vacation (no wedding ceremony or honeymoon when we got married, eventhough I wanted one, but I'll just keep quiet until we have settled the tax issue).<br/><br/>My husband income varies every month. He makes between $3K-5K a month as a freelance artist (illustrator). My only responsiblity is our rent of $1495/mo and whatever bills I have ($300/mo not including the taxes on my CC). My husband takes care of the rest of the monthly spending).<br/>",,,,622140
